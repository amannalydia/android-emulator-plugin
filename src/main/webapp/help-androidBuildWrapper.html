		To test an android application, this is a mandatory step. Each build requires,
		<p>
		1.	Target ID of the system image to use with the AVD. To obtain a list of available targets, 
			use the <b>android list targets</b> command at the command prompt.
		</p>
		<p>
		2.	Serial Number of the target device to which the command should be directed. 
			It is a string created by adb to uniquely identify an emulator/device instance by its console port number. 
			To obtain the serial numbers of running emulator/device instances, use <b>adb devices</b> from the command line.
